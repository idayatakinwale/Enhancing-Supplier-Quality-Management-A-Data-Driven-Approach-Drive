In today's competitive manufacturing landscape, ensuring the quality of raw materials is essential for operational efficiency and product excellence. This project addresses a critical gap in the procurement and supplier management processes at Synergy Manufacturers Ltd, which currently lacks a centralized system to evaluate and monitor supplier performance.

The initiative was launched in response to the growing need to understand supplier quality across various plants and to identify the sources of defects that impact production. Through a concerted effort, the program management team has successfully consolidated data related to raw materials, defects, and vendors, enabling the organization to analyze supplier performance comprehensively.

### Objectives
---

Utilizing Power BI, this project aims to visualize and interpret the data collected, providing insights into vendor and material performance across different plants. 

The **primary objectives** include identifying vendors and plants with the highest defect rates, assessing the impact of defective materials on production downtime, and uncovering any patterns or correlations between materials, vendors, and plants.

By leveraging data analytics, this project seeks to equip Synergy Manufacturers Ltd. with the knowledge required to make informed decisions, improve the overall quality of raw materials sourced for production, quantify the financial implications of poor quality and identify the primary sources of these issues.

### Key Questions Addressed
---

1.	Which vendors/plants are causing the greatest defect quantity?
2.	Which vendors/plants are causing the greatest downtime?
3.	Are there particular combinations of materials and vendors that perform poorly?
4.	Are there particular combinations of vendors and plants that perform poorly?
5.	How does the same vendor and material perform across different plants?
